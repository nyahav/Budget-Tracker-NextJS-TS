 you can just creaet a new table in the schema prisma file,
let's say: RecurrentTransactions ( for example ).
Then you store there your transaction with a "recurrentDay" and "recurrentMonth".
You can also add a start and end if you want 
( in order to have that transaction only in the period that you have choosed ).
Then you can just call an api like /api/checkRecurrentTs where you get all the recurrent transactions,
based on the current day you create the next date on which that recurrent transaction will be created and 
then you query the db in order to see if there is a transaction like that or not. If is not existing than you can create it and thats it.
